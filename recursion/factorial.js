// Question 3: Calculate factorial
// Write a function that returns the factorial of a number. 
// As a quick refresher, a factorial of a number is the result of that number 
// multiplied by the number before it, and the number before that number, and so on, 
// until you reach 1. The factorial of 1 is just 1.

// Sample:
// factorial(5); // 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 === 120

const factorial = (n) => {
  if (n === 1) return n;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

console.log(factorial(5));
